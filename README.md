# LaborMarketPrediction
This project implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to predict labor market inequalities, focusing on wage trends, unemployment rates, and inequality indices over time. The goal is to analyze how various factors influence labor market dynamics and explore potential inequalities that persist across regions or sectors.
